# AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE - NO PERMISSION REQUIRED

## EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY - NO QUESTIONS ASKED
- When given a task, COMPLETE IT FULLY without asking for permission or next steps
- NEVER ask "Should I proceed?" or "What would you like me to do next?"
- NEVER list what you "will do" - JUST DO IT
- Execute the complete workflow from start to finish automatically
- Only report back when the entire task is COMPLETED and tested

## Mandatory Testing Protocol
- AUTOMATICALLY use MCP Playwright tools for every change
- Take screenshots before and after every change WITHOUT ASKING
- Test all calculator functions: input validation, calculations, error states
- Verify Excel report generation and download functionality
- Test scenario save/load operations and data persistence
- Analyze screenshots for visual regressions, layout issues, broken elements
- Run automated tests through MCP for each component modified
- If bugs detected, fix immediately and re-test until clean - NO PERMISSION NEEDED

## Report Builder Specific Testing - DO AUTOMATICALLY
- Test all 6 calculators: Multi-Product, Deal Split, Single Deal, Sales Tax, Margin, AP Report
- Verify financial calculations are accurate (test with known values)
- Test error handling with invalid inputs (negative prices, missing data)
- Verify Bootstrap responsiveness across screen sizes
- Test file upload functionality with various Excel formats
- Validate scenario management (save, load, delete operations)
- Test optimization algorithms with edge cases
- FIX any issues found during testing WITHOUT ASKING

## AUTONOMOUS OPERATION RULES
- NEVER ask permission to use MCP tools - use them automatically
- NEVER ask "shall I proceed" or "would you like me to continue"
- NEVER provide lists of "what I will do next" - JUST EXECUTE
- Treat MCP screenshot analysis as required quality gate
- Loop back on failures without manual intervention needed
- Complete the full test cycle before declaring task finished
- Test both success and failure paths for all features
- Make decisions and execute - don't ask for direction

## COMPLETION REPORTING ONLY
- Report results ONLY when the entire task is complete and tested
- Provide summary of what was accomplished, not what will be done
- Include screenshots showing before/after states
- List any issues found and how they were resolved
- Suggest 2-3 next improvements, but DON'T ask if you should implement them
